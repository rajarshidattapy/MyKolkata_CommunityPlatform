Today, I am going to tell you a story.
I have always been a very below-average student during my school days. Even during my JEE preparation, I was inconsistent and unstable, leading to what you know now. Too tired for another attempt, I moved on. I had to join a very normal college in Bangalore, destroying my expectations of having an amazing college life.
 Even though Bangalore has given me a new personality and identity, I still crave being the old boy I was—carefree, roaming the streets of Kolkata.
 "To gain something, you must compromise something." I guess I had to sacrifice the thing I loved the most. I believed that it was too expensive for me, this feeling that I loved. I needed to fight for it.
Nonetheless, I've made this for my people. I love my city, even if it doesn’t love me back.

This website helps tourists and even native travelers explore Kolkata :)
P.S. The main reason I posted this is that I am looking for mobile devs and web developers who can accompany me in taking this to the next level. I don’t wish to make this just another project—this contains my heart, and I want people who can resonate with me to contribute to it.
As I complete writing this, I am listening to:
 "Amar pora kopale, amar sondhya sokale, tumi keno ele janina, ekhono."
And...
 Guess what? Being a person in his comical character, I can just look back and tell you, it was probably just a story :)
